      <p>The east facing mural (overlooking courts) contains an image that faces the sunrise and provides a welcoming and embracing gesture. Behind the imagery of the ascending staircase to a set of double doors, are aerial views of housing developments and a repeating pattern of the boundary lines of Sulphur Springs. These areas in the image change color depending on the point of view, hinting at the intent of the Fair Housing Act.</p>

      <p>The western mural (facing parking lot) includes similar symbolism using aerial views of Sulphur Springs and stairs in a symmetrical pattern, and the artist’s use of more subdued colors, evokes protection and shelter. Throughout the image is the repetition of the key and keyhole symbols. The central staircases encompassing a keyway are surrounded by two female faces facing opposite directions. 

          Being welcomed, embraced, and comforted makes for a higher quality of life. The opportunity to have a home free from discrimination can promote optimism and confidence. This can help to make our communities healthier. In a place like Sulphur Springs, where diversity is at the forefront of life, freedom from constraint is more important than ever.</p>

<address>1700 N. MacDill Ave </address>
            <p>In their initial concept, artists Edgar Sanchez Cumbas and Guillermo Portieles wanted to represent the hard working individuals in West Tampa “who embraced a thriving a social and cultural community through its broad mix of nationalities and religions.” From this concept and through much input from community leaders and historians, the mural “Kaleidoscope: a Heritage of Color” was created. The mural, commissioned by the City of Tampa, Public Art Program, features five influential figures in Tampa’s history. Individuals depicted in the mural are: Robert “Bob” Saunders, civil rights activist, NAACP Florida director (late 1950s – mid 1960s), Luisa Capetillo, women’s rights activist (early 1900s), Jose Marti, leader of Cuban independence from Spain, poet and writer (late 1800s), Hugh Macfarlane, Scottish immigrant & attorney – founded West Tampa (1892), Fernando Figueredo, first Mayor of West Tampa, (1895).</p>
